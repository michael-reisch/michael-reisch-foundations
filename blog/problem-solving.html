        <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Feeling Blocked:</h2>
        <p>
          One problem I struggled with was the stretch challenge on the
          gradebook kata. The problem asked that you basically take each
          individual step that you did in the previous steps of the kata, and
          combine them into one function that takes in the students, and the
          scores and then adds them to the gradebook. I really wanted to be able
          add the students and then their respective scores to them using one of
          the methods we had been learning, but ultimately had to use dot
          notation to add each student one at a time, and then assign them to
          the appropriate index of the scores array like this:
        </p>
        <p>gradebook.Joseph.testsScores = scores [0]</p>
        <p>
          This worked, but it wasn’t dynamic, so that if the array of students
          or scores ever changed, the function wouldn’t…. function. So, I solved
          the challenge, but am definitely aware that there’s better ways I
          could be doing things. So much room for growth!
          <br />
          <br />
          I used every problem solving technique at my disposal to solve the
          problem in the way I wanted to: pseudocode, googling, trial and error,
          error messages, console.logging, etc. But ultimately came up empty
          handed and settled for the problem being solved, even if it wasn’t in
          the way I wanted it to be solved.

        <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Elegance</h2>
        <p>
          One problem that I solved elegantly was the deBee function in the
          Built-in Methods replit challenge. Through a bit of googling I
          discovered the replace() method and how you can use regular
          expressions (RegEx) to specify string patterns to be replaced and then
          what you want those specific patterns to be replaced with. The
          ‘hints.js’ file suggested using split, then filter then join, etc. I
          didn’t look at ‘hints.js’ until after I completed the problem so I was
          proud that I was able to find an alternative and less verbose method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this I learned the power of googling. Most problems we will
          encounter will have been solved before by people who have been doing
          programming much longer than us. And, thankfully, many of their
          solutions are freely available on the internet. May as well seek them
          out!

        <h2 class="blog-subtitle">How Do I Feel About:</h2>
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t feel super confident with pseudocode yet. For most of these
          problems, I’m able to hold the function construction in my mind as I
          try to solve it. Admittedly, I just jump right in to trying to solve
          the problem before doing pseudocode and only turn to pseudocode when
          I’m stuck. Then, after jotting down the basic structure of what I’m
          trying to do, an idea will pop into my head, which I then test out.
          Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. But the pseudocode is
          definitely an effective way of taking a more generalized perspective
          of the problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Trying Something</h3>
        <p>
          I think of this technique as ‘trial and error’. Just kind of messing
          around, moving pieces around, seeing what the outcome is to get a
          deeper understanding of what’s going on. I quite like this technique
          because it’s quite playful. Like a kid playing with blocks, seeing how
          many ways they can assemble them, how the blocks balance, does it fall
          over? How high can I go? Oh.. if I build a stronger foundation, it’s
          stronger overall. It’s fun!
        </p>
        <h3>Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
        <p>
          This is one that I haven’t really tried yet, as all the other methods
          have served me well. Although sometimes, when I’m stuck, I do talk out
          loud to myself. Just kind of saying out loud what I’m trying to do.
          Certainly doesn’t hurt!
        </p>
        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
          This is a great method, because you can return different variables and
          such to see if what you think is happening, is actually happening. You
          can move it around, see what’s returning at different parts of your
          program. I feel quite confident with this technique. I think of this
          as being a tool in the trial and error process.
        </p>
        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>
          Good ol’ Google. My friend, my oracle. I probably spend more time
          Googling things than I do writing actual code. I’m hoping this ratio
          will reverse as I get more skilled in programming, but for now, I
          really see it as a method of learning, not just problem solving. By
          researching, seeking things out, you’re broadening your exposure to so
          many different methods and techniques. What you’re reading on Google
          might not solve your current problem, but it might help with a future
          one!
        </p>
        <h3>Asking Peers/Coaches for Help</h3>
        <p>
          As I expected, being my stubborn self, I have not reached out for help
          yet. I’ve been able to solve every problem I’ve encountered so far
          (under time) through the aforementioned techniques. I’m sure this
          track record won’t last forever. There’s a problem waiting for me in
          the future where all these techniques will be exercises in futility. I
          know that when this time comes, I’ll reach out for help.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          As much as I want to focus solely on the technical aspects of
          programming, reflection is definitely important. It cements the
          concepts I’m learning well into my mind. They settle like sand in a
          jar full of marbles; filling in all the nooks and crannies. Lately,
          I’ve been having dreams about programming. Also, I’m feeling my mind
          change. The way thoughts form feels more efficient. Like they jump
          from thought to thought faster and in a more creative way.
