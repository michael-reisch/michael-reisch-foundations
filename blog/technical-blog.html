        To properly explain this concept, we must first explore the CSS box
        model. Basically, the box model consists of a box object in the body of
        a website. This box object consists of the content, surrounded by
        padding, surrounded by border, surrounded by margin.

        Every html element has a default display property. The display property
        determines the element layout behaviour in relation to other elements on
        the page. For example, &#60;div&#62;, &#60;p&#62; and &#60;h1&#62;
        (among other) elements are block-level elements. This means that the
        element's box will start on their own line, and take up the entire width
        of that line. It's important to note that you
        <strong>can</strong> adjust height and width properties of block-level
        elements. Block-level elements will push other elements onto another
        line. Below is an example of three block-level elements and its
        corresponding html and CSS:

        There are numerous different display values that you can use to
        manipulate how each element flows within the layout of your web page.
        The values we will be looking at in this blog post are inline and
        inline-block.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Inline</h2>
      <p>
        Some elements that have display: inline; as their default property are:
        &#60;span&#62;, and &#60;label&#62;. Inline elements will take up only
        as much space as they need, will not push other elements to new lines
        (so they will display side-by-side), and
        <strong>do not</strong> accept width, height or top-bottom margin
        properties. However, they will accept padding and left-right margin
        properties. Below is an example of the aforementioned three divs, which
        have a default display property of block, changed to having a display
        property of inline. The html is the same except for the inner text of
        the div.

      <p>
        Notice how the divs, which have a default display property of block, are
        now right next to eachother, sharing the same line. Notice also how the
        height and width properties are completely ignored. This is the nature
        of the inline display property!

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Inline-Block</h2>
      <p>
        There are not too many html elements with inline-block as their default
        display property. But some that do are: &#60;img&#62; and
        &#60;button&#62;. Inline-block acts kind of like a hybrid of block and
        inline display properties. They are similar to block-level elements in
        that you can adjust the height, width and margin properties. And they
        are similar to inline elements in that they can be placed next to
        eachother on the same line. Please see the examples below, the html is
        the same as the first example with the exception of the inner text of
        the div:

      />

      <p>
        Notice how the divs, which have a default display property of block, are
        now next to eachother on the same line <strong>and</strong> the height,
        width and margin properties are all honoured. Such is the nature of the
        inline-block display property!
