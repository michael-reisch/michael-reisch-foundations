    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>

    <p>
      The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to
      handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.
      “Emotional intelligence is the key to both personal and professional
      success.”
    </p>

    <h3>Signs of Emotional Intelligence:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An ability to identify and describe what people are feeling.</li>
      <li>An awareness of personal strengths and limitations.</li>
      <li>Self-confidence and self-acceptance.</li>
      <li>The ability to let go of mistakes.</li>
      <li>An ability to accept and embrace change.</li>
      <li>A strong sense of curiosity, particularly about other people.</li>
      <li>Feelings of empathy and concern for others.</li>
      <li>Showing sensitivity to the feelings of other people.</li>
      <li>Accepting responsibility for mistakes.</li>
      <li>The ability to manage emotions in difficult situations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Components of Emotional Intelligence:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Perceiving emotions – The first step in understanding emotions. This can
        include understanding body language and facial expressions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reasoning with emotions – Using emotions to promote thinking and
        cognitive activity, prioritizing what we pay attention to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understanding emotions – How we interpret the source of the emotions of
        others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Managing emotions – Regulating emotions and responding appropriately.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      How is Emotional Intelligence Different from Intellectual Intelligence?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence involves your ability to regulate your own emotions
      as well as how to interact with and perceive others. With a high EQ, you
      can objectively shift awareness to your own emotional state and the
      emotional state of others with whom you interact. By having a high EQ, you
      can more effectively work with others towards a common goal by avoiding
      misunderstandings arising from a lack of emotional awareness that could
      lead to miscommunications and emotional outbursts.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is important because it acts as a way for smooth
      collaboration. If all collaborators have a keen awareness of the emotional
      state of themselves and their peers, then they can operate from a place of
      empathy and understanding. Thus, the team will be more effective at
      achieving their goals than if the team-members only had high IQ. You could
      have a room of the most intelligent people in the world to create a
      technological breakthrough, but if they don’t have adequate EQ, the team
      is less likely to achieve their goal, and if they do, it may not reach its
      highest potential.
