          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            I’ve learned that neuroplasticity and growth mindset played a role
            in applying for and attending Dev Academy. It was the belief that I
            could learn the tech and human skills necessary to build a new
            career from scratch that pushed me to take the risk, quit my job and
            pursue a new dream.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’ve learned that a lot of the skills I’ve built in my previous
            career could be somewhat useful in this new chapter. This is
            refreshing because I’ve struggled with imposter syndrome quite a
            bit. It’s good to know that tech companies aren’t only concerned
            with the flashiest tech skills and want people who are adept at
            working in teams just as much.
          </li>
          <li>
            My ego… I’ve learned that I want to be liked in general. I want to
            do good work and be recognized for it, just like anyone, I suppose.
            I’ve learned that I may need to put my ego and it’s fears of failure
            or humiliation aside if I want to grow interpersonally.

          Roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and
          programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Values, empathy and self-awareness play roles in everything we do. But
          in learning and programming specifically, your values reside as a
          foundation for how you learn, what you decide to program and how your
          creations interact in the real world. If you value kindness you won’t
          build (or learn to build) something that goes out into the world and
          does not create or spread kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy is crucial in a collaborative learning environment because you
          must be aware of how other people are feeling in order to work with
          them effectively. Some levels of empathic awareness can come from
          non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language. These
          can be signals that maybe someone is dealing with something and can
          offer the opportunity to allow that person to speak of what they’re
          dealing with if they choose to. This also applies with programming
          because, in general, programmers work in teams and the team must be
          empathic with its members in order to be effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness is super important for learning because it acts as a
          gauge of how you’re doing. Are you struggling? Do you need to reach
          out for help? By being self-aware you can recognize what you need to
          take care of yourself. This also applies with programming because as
          much as we may work with computers, we are still human. We must check
          in with ourselves and see how we’re going. How do our minds feel? Our
          bodies? Are our emotions tumultuous? Do we need a break? Some
          exercise? Self-awareness allows us to (quite literally) be aware of
          ourselves and be honest with what we need in order to move forward.

          What has surprised you the most about core learning?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Just how amazing human beings are. We’re so malleable, no matter our
          age or past. It’s surprising to me that these core skills aren’t
          taught more broadly. They should be taught in schools from the very
          beginning. Imagine an entire generation that has been taught values,
          empathy and self-awareness they’re entire childhood. Everyone would
          benefit from that.

          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I guess the most challenging aspects of the core learning was
          confronting the things that I want to improve and recognizing that in
          order to improve on these things, I’m going to have to be pushed out
          of my comfort zone. It’s only through discomfort that we grow,
          ultimately. So just being in anticipation of that future push outside
          my comfort zone has been a bit challenging.

          Why is Dev Academy spending so much time focusing on core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Well, the most direct answer is because you’ve been told by the tech
          industry hiring bootcamp graduates that core skills are in high
          demand. Tech skills are necessary to get a job in the tech industry,
          but if you’re not able to work effectively in a team, then those tech
          skills don’t mean as much. Programmers, despite working with computers
          all day, are generally working in teams. And working in teams
          effectively means being empathetic to your colleagues, being
          self-aware enough to be honest with yourself and your team members and
          having values that align with the organization in which you are
          working.

          Does the time you spent studying core learning feel like a waste of
          time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          No, definitely not. I feel like if there’s some programming concept I
          don’t understand then I can just study it a bit extra in my own time.
          But I’m eager to learn how these core skills are best utilized within
          the tech industry specifically. I don’t think I could learn that in
          any other context. As someone who’s never worked in an office or
          ‘desk’ setting before, I want to experience how teams in these
          settings operate. This is something that, like programming, can only
          really be learned by doing. So I think it’s great that Dev Academy
          puts as much emphasis on core learning as programming. It paints an
          effective picture of the reality of building a tech career.
