    <h1>The Fundamentals of JavaScript</h1>
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Relationship of HTML, CSS and JS Analogy</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s say we’re going to build a house. HTML would be the frame of the
        house. We know the house has two bedrooms and one bathroom, but at the
        moment they’re just empty rooms with no walls. Just bare wood framing.
        <br />
        <br />

        CSS would be the decoration of the house: the walls, the paint, the
        appliances, the furniture, the lighting. All the decoration that make a
        house a pleasant place to live is CSS.
        <br />
        <br />
        JavaScript would be all the things you can do in the house and make it a
        home: eat, sleep, make the bed. I might even say that JS includes all
        the utilities of the house as well: plumbing, electricity, gas. As these
        move elements around the house to be used to do things, just like how JS
        moves data around and manipulates other elements.

      <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>
      <p>
        Control flow in JavaScript is the order in which computer executes
        statements in a script. By default, the code is run from top to bottom,
        first line to last line. This changes if there are structures such as
        loops or conditionals which change the control flow.
        <br />
        <br />
        A loop would interrupt the default control flow and cycle through the
        loop until there is nothing left to cycle through, and then continue
        with the rest of the code. A conditional statement would only run if
        certain conditions are met, and then run code within that conditional
        statement, before continuing on with the rest of the code.
        <br />
        <br />
        An analogy of this is an airport. The normal control flow is planes
        taking off and landing. The control flow is interrupted to cycle through
        the loops of loading passengers one at a time, loading luggage one at a
        time and offloading passengers and offloading luggage. Also, if the
        plane requires fuel, then the fuel is refilled. If the plane needs
        maintenance, then it is taken out of the control flow until it is ready
        to fly again.

      <h2>What Is The DOM?</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM is the Document Object Model: a large collection of key: value
        pairs (aka nodes) that represent all of the structure, content and style
        within a web page. Because the DOM is represented as an object,
        programming languages such as JavaScript can interact and change
        elements of the DOM efficiently.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you consider a basic HTML document with its myriad elements such as
        H1, p, form, article, etc., each of these elements is a node. Each node
        is part of the overall DOM object. Additionally, many of the nodes are
        objects as well with different properties that can be adjusted. For
        example, you may have a div with id=”bigList”. This div is an object
        that has one property (of many) called innerHTML. The innerHTML property
        is what is written between the opening and closing tags:
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="image of div html syntax" />
      <p>
        This innerHTML text is then rendered to the webpage. If you wanted to
        access this div and then change its innerHTML, you would access it with
        the following syntax in JS:
      </p>
      <img
        src=""
        alt="document.getElementById(‘bigList’).innerHTML
        = ‘Dang this is a big list…’"
      />
      <p>
        With this syntax, you have adjusted the innerHTML text of the div with
        id=’bigList’ to ‘Dang this is a big list…’. This syntax is called dot
        notation. It is a means of traversing the DOM. First you access the
        overall ‘document’, followed by getElementById(‘bigList’) which
        specifically targets an element with id=’bigList’, followed by the
        property you want to change, in this case the innerHTML property. All of
        these steps are separated by ‘dots’. You could think of each dot as a
        step deeper into the DOM. First you enter the DOM, then select
        specifically what element you want you change, followed by which
        property you want to change, followed by an equals sign and then what
        the selected property of the selected element will be set to.

      <p>
        Arrays and objects are both elements to store data, though they store
        them in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        An array can be thought in its most simplistic form as a list. Each item
        of this list has an index starting from 0. Imagine a grocery list with
        everything you need to buy, and each individual food item has a number
        starting from zero next to it. The items in the list can be accessed via
        their index, though the index is not directly visible in the array
        itself.
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="image of an array" />
      <p>
        An object, on the other hand, is slightly more complex in that they
        store data with what are called key: value pairs. You can store data for
        just about anything in an object. Say I want to create an object for my
        imaginary pet hamster. It would look like this:
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="image of an object" />
      <p>
        If I wanted to access the data in my hamster object, I would use the
        following syntax:
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="accessing objects syntax" />
      <p>
        Arrays and objects are extremely powerful programming tools. You can
        even nest objects within objects, arrays within objects, objects within
        arrays and so much more! But this is a topic for another time…

      <h1>What Are Functions?</h1>
      <p>
        Functions are basically reusable blocks of code that can be called
        infinitely throughout a program in an efficient way. They are helpful
        because if you find yourself using a specific block of code repeatedly,
        you can instead define this repeating code as a function and then call
        it whenever it is needed. This helps to cut down on clutter and make
        your program easier to read and understand.
