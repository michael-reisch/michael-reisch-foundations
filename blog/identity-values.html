      <h2>An Ethical Decision:</h2>
      <p class="">
        An ethical decision I have made happened when I was working as an
        arborist. Several years ago, the company I worked for was contracted to
        cut down a large Sycamore tree in Aro Valley that was located on private
        property. The tree was probably close to 100 years old and very large
        and apparently perfectly healthy. Unfortunately, it had a worrying lean
        towards the client’s house and was growing almost directly above it. To
        add to the risk, the tree was growing on a hillside that had been
        excavated long ago to make a driveway. <br />
        <br />
        If the tree ever failed at the roots and fell over, his house would be
        destroyed and anyone that was in the house could potentially be injured
        or worse. As we were setting up our work site, two women approached us
        holding a clipboard. They showed us the clipboard and explained that
        they lived in the neighboring apartment building. The clipboard held a
        collection of signatures of people who opposed the removal of this
        large, prominent tree that had been a part of the landscape for a
        lifetime. While this petition held no power over our client’s decision
        to remove the tree, it put us as a company in a tricky situation.
        <br /><br />
        To add to the complexity, we were also informed that the petitioners had
        contacted Wellington City Council about making the Sycamore a
        “Heritage/Notable Tree” and the council was considering giving it this
        protection. (A Heritage Tree is a tree that is under council protection
        due to its visual, ecological or historical importance.) <br /><br />Do
        we carry out the work we have been contracted to do and then suffer the
        potential blowback from the surrounding community? Do we walk away from
        the job, lose out on the revenue and potentially leave our client’s home
        in a risky situation but avoid a negative reputation in the
        community?<br /><br />
        My boss, colleagues and I discussed our options. None of them were
        ideal, but I offered a compromise. I suggested we prune the tree by
        removing some heavy branches nearest the house. By doing this we would
        reduce the overall weight of the canopy, thus reducing the strain on the
        roots caused by the lean towards the house and the risk of the wind
        blowing the tree over. The tree would retain its beautiful natural
        appearance and the risk to the house would be somewhat reduced.
        <br /><br />My boss agreed and we negotiated with the client to carry
        out the pruning for a reduced price. While the client was not happy that
        the tree would remain standing, he ultimately had no choice because
        every other tree company in the city had refused to do the job after
        being confronted by the petitioners. A Wellington City Council arborist
        arrived at our work site as we were pruning the tree and praised our
        decision and professionalism. <br /><br />Upon reflection, I’m very
        proud of the decision to reach a compromise, even though the compromise
        probably benefited the petitioners more than our client. In making this
        decision I weighed up the value of protecting this one tree over
        generating revenue and mitigated the risk to the client’s house by
        utilizing arboriculture’s best practices to ensure the tree would remain
        standing well into the future.

      <h2>
        How my culture and people around me influenced my values and identity:
      </h2>
      <p>
        I find this question quite difficult to answer because for nearly all my
        life, I’ve felt like an outsider in the culture in which I was raised in
        the US. I didn’t really start to think about the power of culture until
        I entered University and confronted my understanding of US culture and
        how my values aligned within it. During this time, I think I experienced
        a sort of reckoning within myself where I felt lost, adrift within my
        own culture. <br /><br />I think this ultimately led to coming to NZ in
        early 2017. Obviously, 2016 was a time when the US was going through its
        own cultural reckoning and it did weigh heavily on me as the values that
        I held within myself were not only not reflected in the wider culture,
        but actively and enthusiastically stomped on and mocked by the Orange
        Man and his followers. <br /><br />Only in coming to NZ and beginning to
        put down roots did I feel like my values were reflected in the wider
        culture. It was incredibly refreshing, and layers of my anxieties slowly
        dissipated. <br /><br />The person that had the most influence on my
        values and identity would be my mother. She always emphasized “The
        Golden Rule” (Treat others how you want to be treated). She also pushed
        me into piano lessons as a child which has given me a very necessary
        creative outlet as an adult. I don’t know who I would be without music.
        With these values instilled in me I naturally developed into a person
        that treats every living being with respect, values creativity, beauty
        and hard work. <br /><br />The people that affect my values and identity
        now would be my friends and musical collaborators. They help me value
        art and creativity, as well as inspire me to follow my goals.

      <h2>My Strengths:</h2>
      <p>
        According to the VIA Character Strengths Profile Assessment, my top five
        strengths are honesty, appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude,
        fairness and hope. These strengths will be very helpful to me throughout
        my learning journey in myriad ways. Honesty will help me be honest with
        my fellow students, my facilitators and myself. By being honest in all
        facets of life, you always know where you stand. The waters are clear.
        The way forward is not obscured by the fog of lies or cognitive
        dissonance.<br /><br />
        Appreciation of beauty and excellence will help me acknowledge when I’ve
        done good work and when those around me have done good work as well.<br /><br />
        Gratitude is so important in life. No one makes it through life without
        help, and it’s important to be grateful for that help and to express
        thanks openly and often. I’ve always believed in fairness. You never
        know a person’s full story when you first meet them: you never know why
        they are the way they are, the challenges they’ve overcome, the weight
        they carry. The very least you can do is treat everyone equally with
        respect, fairness and justice. <br /><br />This will be beneficial in my
        learning journey as I collaborate with others with diverse backgrounds
        and much to teach me. Hope is important because even when challenges
        mount, hope for a better future can be the thing that pushes me onwards.
        This will help in my learning journey because programming is hard! With
        the hope that I will achieve my goals, I am more likely to carry on 

      <h2>My Limitations:</h2>
      <p>
        One limitation that that I have in terms of my learning and career
        development is imposter syndrome. As someone who has only ever done a
        physical labor job for over a decade, I have often questioned my ability
        to enter a field that is pure mental problem solving. As I’ve been going
        through this first Sprint, this feeling has abated slightly. I feel like
        I belong here, and I’ve made the right choice.

      <h2>Conflict Resolution Examples:</h2>
      <p>
        When I was working as an arborist, I was a foreman. With this role, you
        must manage all aspects of a job site including your crew members’
        personalities. There was one day when we were undertaking a job of
        removing a large conifer tree. I instructed my apprentice to do the work
        as it was a good situation for him to learn. He got underway and was
        doing fine but was running quite a bit behind schedule. Normally this
        wouldn’t be a big issue, but on this day, we were expecting a Hiab in
        the afternoon to take away the standing trunk sections. It’s not a piece
        of equipment we can have waiting around as it costs hundreds of dollars
        an hour.<br /><br />
        I explained this to my apprentice and respectfully asked him to come
        down from the tree so I could take over and make up for lost time.
        Instead of understanding the situation, he exploded, made a big scene
        and drove off in a crucial company vehicle. I knew from previous
        experience that this employee had life-long anger issues. I knew that if
        I reacted to his outburst with anger, it would only amplify his own
        anger. I stayed calm, explained the situation and tried to be
        compassionate towards him. I understood that his anger issues arose from
        events in his childhood that were beyond his control. This current
        situation was, ultimately, connected to those events in his past. I
        didn’t blame him for his anger but had to inform my employer of the
        situation. We eventually did clear the air and continued to work well
        together. <br /><br />I think my strategies were effective in that they
        didn’t escalate the situation further. The only way the situation would
        have been avoided would have been to not ask him to do the work in the
        first place. As a foreman, training my apprentices was part of my job.
        And if I didn’t give them the opportunity to step outside of their
        comfort zone, they wouldn’t learn and improve. Perhaps it would have
        been better if I had told him from the beginning that if time ran short,
        I would have to take over. This would have acted as a means of managing
        his expectations and potentially avoided the trigger of unintentionally
        making him feel ineffective.
