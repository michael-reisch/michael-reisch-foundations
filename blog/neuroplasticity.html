        <p>
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity has far-reaching
          benefits for people. It reinforces the idea that our reality is often
          a reflection of our beliefs or expectations. If you believe that your
          mind is fixed, then your mind will be fixed. If you believe that your
          mind is limitless, that you can learn anything with a bit of work,
          that you can improve, alter and build your brain and mind to become
          anything that you want it to be, then this also will become true.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have engaged with the principles of neuroplasticity for several
          years, at least. Once I understood that my brain was malleable, I
          started to let go of some assumptions that I had about myself. I began
          embracing the fact that I could improve characteristics of myself that
          I thought were flawed. I’ve done this through reading, intentional
          practice and meditation. It’s interesting how we can just think about
          doing something and still show improvement in it without physically
          doing it. I’ve utilized this in my piano practice where I’ll imagine
          myself playing a particular piece if I don’t have a piano nearby. When
          I finally do sit down at a piano, the piece feels just as fresh as if
          I had been practicing it regularly. I hope to use this with
          programming by trying to consciously think about the concepts even
          when I’m not actively studying.

        <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is the understanding that our minds are not fixed, that
          they are malleable. And by recognizing the principles of
          neuroplasticity, and utilizing these principles in learning, our mind
          becomes unhindered by the limitations of a fixed mindset. With a
          growth mindset, our ability to grow and learn new skills through hard
          work becomes apparent: we aren’t limited by the flaws that we see in
          ourselves. This is relevant because Our limitations are only imagined.
          With a growth mindset, you can learn anything, do anything, become
          anything you imagine if you want it enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been and will continue to integrate a growth mindset into my
          learning journey by ignoring any inner dialogue that tells me I’m
          incapable of doing something. In the front of my mind I’ll keep
          believing that I can change my brain, I can change my skillsets, I can
          learn anything I want to.

          Blending Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset With My Learning Plan
        </h2>

        <p>
          I’ve been utilizing my understanding of neuroplasticity and growth
          mindset for quite a while and will continue to do so throughout my
          learning journey. A big part of really leaning into these concepts is
          building habits. For me, the habit is just sitting down and doing the
          work every day to understand what I need to know in order to progress
          to the next level on understanding programming. It’s the repetition
          and continued exposure to challenging concepts that will force the
          brain to generate new neural pathways and turn those spindly little
          connections into superhighways of knowledge over time. By building and
          maintaining the habit to continuously DO THE WORK, and with the power
          of a growth mindset to give me hope that I will understand these
          things eventually, neuroplasticity will follow, and my brain will
          change and my skill and ability will grow over time.
