    <h1>CSS Concept Research - display: inline; vs display: inline-block;</h1>
    <p>
      To properly explain this concept, we must first explore the CSS box model.
      Basically, the box model consists of a box object in the body of a
      website. This box object consists of the content, surrounded by padding,
      surrounded by border, surrounded by margin.

      Every html element has a default display property. The display property
      determines the element layout behaviour in relation to other elements on
      the page. For example, &#60;div&#62;, &#60;p&#62; and &#60;h1&#62; (among
      other) elements are block-level elements. This means that the element's
      box will start on their own line, and take up the entire width of that
      line. It's important to note that you <strong>can</strong> adjust height
      and width properties of block-level elements. Block-level elements will
      push other elements onto another line. Below is an example of three
      block-level elements and it's corresponding html and CSS:

    <p>
      There are numerous different display values that you can use to manipulate
      how each element flows within the layout of your web page. The values we
      will be looking at in this blog post are inline and inline-block.
    </p>

    <h1>Inline</h1>
    <p>
      Some elements that have display: inline; as their default property are:
      &#60;span&#62;, and &#60;label&#62;. Inline elements will take up only as
      much space as they need, will not push other elements to new lines (so
      they will display side-by-side), and
      <strong>do not</strong> accept width, height or top-bottom margin
      properties. However, they will accept padding and left-right margin
      properties. Below is an example of the aforementioned three divs, which
      have a default display property of block, changed to having a display
      property of inline. The html is the same except for the inner text of the
      div.
    </p>

    />

    <p>
      Notice how the divs, which have a default display property of block, are
      now right next to eachother, sharing the same line. Notice also how the
      height and width properties are completely ignored. This is the nature of
      the inline display property!
    </p>

    <h1>Inline-Block</h1>
    <p>
      There are not too many html elements with inline-block as their default
      display property. But some that do are: &#60;img&#62; and
      &#60;button&#62;. Inline-block acts kind of like a hybrid of block and
      inline display properties. They are similar to block-level elements in
      that you can adjust the height, width and margin properties. And they are
      similar to inline elements in that they can be placed next to eachother on
      the same line. Please see the examples below, the html is the same as the
      first example with the exception of the inner text of the div:

      Notice how the divs, which have a default display property of block, are
      now next to eachother on the same line <strong>and</strong> the height,
      width and margin properties are all honoured. Such is the nature of the
      inline-block display property!
