    <h1>CSS Concept Research - display: inline; vs display: inline-block;</h1>
    <p>
      To properly explain this concept, we must first explore the CSS box model.
      Basically, the box model consists of a box object in the body of a
      website. This box object consists of the content, surrounded by padding,
      surrounded by border, surrounded by margin.

    <p>
      Every html element has a default display property. The display property
      determines the element layout behaviour in relation to other elements on
      the page. For example, &#60;div&#62;, &#60;p&#62; and &#60;h1&#62; (among
      other) elements are block-level elements. This means that the element's box will start on
      their own line, and take up the entire width of that line. Block-level
      elements will push other elements onto another line. You can adjust this
      default behaviour by accessing the display property in CSS like this:

      <p>element-selector {display: value}</p> 
      <p>
        There are numerous different display values that you can use to manipulate 
        the layout of your web page. The values we will be looking at in this blog
        post are inline and inline-block.
