    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t really know what my long-term goal or career pathway is yet, other
      than to work in the tech sector. I feel like there’s still a lot I don’t
      know about the industry in general; what the possible paths even are, if
      they’re connected, or how to get there. What initially piqued my interest
      about a tech career path was data science. I was fascinated by being able
      to pull actionable ideas from flows of data. During this time (2018?), I
      spent some time learning Python (went all the way through a book called
      Python Crash Course), but was ultimately intimidated by my lack of
      mathematical knowledge. I eventually lost motivation and my self-study
      stagnated. More recently, my ideas coalesce around building programs that
      measure, catalogue and interpret things in the physical world. I have an
      idea to create a program that utilizes blockchain to create an inventory
      of trees throughout cities (worldwide?) to catalogue their growth,
      interventions by arborists, amount of sequestered carbon dioxide, oxygen
      produced, etc. so that regional councils/governments can manage their
      urban forests over centuries instead of using software on centralized
      servers based overseas that may not allow for a tree-life timeline. I’ve
      been pondering ways to permanently and harmlessly tag council trees with a
      QR code (or similar) so that council arborists can quickly access data
      about that specific tree, and log interventions (pruning) that they
      perform over the years or allow people in the community to scan it and
      find information about the tree, or even request an arborist intervention.
      On top of this, create software that can allow arborist practitioners a
      way to keep a vast inventory of the trees (on public or private land) they
      work on over time, make work-requests and create sales-quotes (private
      businesses). I think using drones equipped with specialized scanners to
      gather environmental data and then building programs to interpret that
      data and devise actions to benefit the environment and humanity would be
      absolutely fascinating. One day I’d like to equip sensors to a tree that
      measure the flow of its sap, the bending motion of its branches, the
      levels of sunlight, rain and wind and run this data into a program that
      transforms it into instrumental midi to create ‘tree music’, if you will.
      Cyber security could be cool? I like the idea of it, but again, know very
      little about the reality of being a cyber security practitioner. I’m
      interested in using CNC software and 3D printing to make physical products
      or custom furniture. Houses? With all of that being said, web development
      seems like the best foundation from which to build this as yet unrealized
      future. I would be grateful to land any job that allows me to learn and
      grow as a developer and decipher the path forward as I go. I’m excited to
      learn JavaScript to learn how to expand from a basic webpage into a web
      app that can perform calculations, extract data, etc. It’s hard for me to
      put into words how important this career change is to me. It’s almost like
      I can’t progress in other areas of my life until I climb this mountain.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to learning, I think one of my strengths is that I’m pretty
      self-sufficient. With a bit of instruction, some encouragement, and
      external expectation I can really focus solely on the goal of learning
      without any worries of distraction or not meeting deadlines. I’m fully
      capable of overcoming most obstacles with a bit of searching around
      online. I’m finding myself sitting down to study, then I realize I’m
      hungry and that almost 5 hours has gone by. I think I am entering a kind
      of ‘flow state’ and really getting into some deep work.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my limitations is probably my social anxiety: I may be hesitant to
      reach out for help. With the discord server, I’m finding I’m not super
      eager to put my voice out there for fear of embarrassing myself. I think
      I’m individually quite confident, and socially incredibly not confident.
      There is a reason I deleted all of my social media accounts several years
      ago. And that reason is that it caused me anxiety. I acknowledge that the
      discord server is not the same thing as social media, but I hope the
      parallels are at least somewhat clear. My anxiety is amped up a bit since
      everyone on the discord server is people I’ve never met, yet already have
      so much respect for. I’m also a little bit nervous about the social
      aspects of the in-person bootcamp for this same reason. I’ve always been a
      bit of a hermit… However, I know deep down that, long-term, this is not
      the best way to be. I’m not pursuing web-development as an excuse to lock
      myself away in a room with a computer and type away (OK, maybe I’m glad
      there is an aspect of this in web-development). But really, I want to
      boost my social capital. I need to build a network. I want my social
      batteries to be depleted. I want to be pushed out of my comfort zone. I
      want to be valuable to others. The only way to grow in this way is to
      approach and then exceed my limitations and fears surrounding social
      anxiety.
    </p>

    <h2>
      3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I want my social skills to be developed. My whole life I’ve dealt with
      some form of social anxiety, though I may not have realized it until only
      a few years ago. I want to be a better conversationalist. I want to be
      more capable of being helpful to the people around me. I want to be sought
      out when people need help: to be the person that others think of when
      they’re in a tough situation.
    </p>
    <h2>
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      This should include:
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </li>
        <li>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I intend to dedicate time to study every day. During weekdays I will
      dedicate 5-8 hours and during weekends, half an hour minimum. Any days
      during the week that are missed or not as productive will be made up on
      the weekends. As far as working productively and safely with other
      learners goes, I’ve always found that I’m quite capable of working well
      with pretty much anyone from diverse backgrounds. As an arborist, I worked
      with all types of people from all over the world with varying worldviews
      in stressful and often quite physically dangerous situations with dire
      consequences if the things didn’t go according to plan. In these
      situations, you have to work well with your team, no matter who they are.
      I am non-confrontational by nature and ultimately just want everyone to
      live their dreams and be happy. I am pretty even-keeled emotionally, so
      even if I don’t vibe with someone, I’m able to put my own emotions aside
      in order to accomplish our goals. This could, however, work against me if
      I’m always putting myself as less important. I will have to make sure that
      I’m not bottling things up and that I express myself in a healthy way
      before I retract into my shell. When things are building up and starting
      to get to me, I will most likely lean on my partner, friends and family.
      And if I feel like the things that are getting to me are directly related
      to or will affect my learning, then I will reach out to one of my
      homegroup facilitators. Once the in-person portion of the bootcamp starts,
      I will need to make sure I’m open and willing to express my emotions in a
      healthy way to my cohort and facilitators.
    </p>
    <h2>
      5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h2>
    <p>
      I commit to seeking help if I am struggling with something. If it is a
      technical problem, I will seek help if I don’t feel like I’m making some
      sort of progress within half an hour. I will post on discord or ask a
      facilitator directly. And if it is a personal problem, I will seek help
      from my support system (partner, friends, family). If I feel like this
      personal problem that will affect my ability to learn and perform as I am
      expected to, then I will reach out to a facilitator and explain the
      situation. If it is a personal problem that is related to bootcamp and how
      I am operating within it, I will seek help from my homegroup facilitator
      or my cohort.
    </p>
    <h2>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      I expect guidance in learning and support when the learning is hard.
      Understanding if I’m socially awkward. A bit of a push to open up and take
      initiative in social situations certainly helps.
    </p>
    <h2>
      7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
      committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments
      like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have no children and am not currently employed. Dev Academy is my sole
      focus. Should anything come up that will interfere with my learning, I
      will inform my facilitators ASAP.
