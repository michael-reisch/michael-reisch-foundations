            I've been a climber for half my lifetime. First started climbing
            rocks in University. Then a professional tree-climbing arborist
            after University. Now that I'm no longer working as an arborist, I
            have the energy to return to rock climbing purely for the fun of it.

            Working with trees for over a decade has given me a strong
            appreciate for tree's slow-motion gymnastics. I am constantly amazed
            by the strength of massive trees. What bewildering organisms! My
            favorite aspect of arboriculture was tree preservation. Trees that
            reside in urban environments often have hard lives: they have to
            compete with limited rootspace, powerlines, buildings, roadways,
            footpaths, construction and pollution. My job was to act as the
            negotiator between the natural environment and the built
            environment. Unfortunately, the built environment almost always
            wins. But if you work with trees with the right methodology, they
            can thrive in our concrete jungles. And we need as many trees in our
            cities as we can manage. Their selflessness can save us.

            I first took piano lessons from the age of 8-16. I stopped the
            lessons in high-school and focussed on sports. I rediscovered my
            love for music in University when my flatmate acquired an old piano
            from the theater department. I sat down at it for the first time and
            found it familiar. These days I am in a band and I am the
            songwriter, lead vocalist and keyboard player.

            I have always been drawn to the ocean. Even though I grew up in a
            coastless state, my family and I often traveled to the coast for
            summer vacations. You couldn't keep me out of the water. I loved
            being tossed around by the waves and digging my feet into the sand.
            New Zealand's extensive coastline is one of many aspects of this
            beautiful country that pulled me here.

            I think anyone who has flown on a plane has taken this exact photo
            at some point. Coming to New Zealand in early 2017 was the first
            time I ventured overseas from the United States. Five years later, I
            have been granted Permanent Residency and now I'm following my
            dreams in this wonderful place. I feel so lucky to be here and all
            of the hard work has paid off. This is where my future will grow.

            Being alive is such an amazing experience. We are the universe

            swirling around out there beyond the stars. Anything is possible.
            The only meaning in life is that which you give it.

            The mountains of New Zealand drew me here from halfway around the
            world. When I arrived, they did not disappoint. I spent my first
            four months in New Zealand travelling around in a 1989 Toyota Hiace
            that I named Percy. It was an experience I'll never forget.

            One summer between University semesters, my friend Louis and I took
            a road trip across the USA from Ohio to Washington, south through
            Oregon and into northern California and onwards to Yosemite Valley
            and back again to Ohio. It was the first time I realized how vast
            the world is. How many people, places and ways of being there are.
            How much beauty there is in the world and how eager I was to see it.
            We stopped at various locations all along our journey and climbed
            rocks, slept on the side of roads in hammocks, hiked, wandered,
            swam, got lost. It was a turning-point in my life.
